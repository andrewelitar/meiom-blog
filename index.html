          When it comes to spending money, I’ve made so many mistakes. When I
          think about the amount of money I’ve wasted in the past, I feel bad
          in my stomach.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn’t have the best mental model for my financial life back then.
        </p>
        <p>
          As someone who practices Stoicism and Mindfulness, I don’t get
          attached to those feelings. But still, it does hurt a little bit.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, I think I bought a new winter jacket almost every year
          until four or five years ago when I finally decided to spend a grand
          on a high-quality jacket.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spent probably twice as much in the ten prior years. But now that
          I have a great (and warm) winter parka, I don’t even think about
          getting a new one. So I’m not spending any more money. I’m also not
          spending time and energy on finding new jackets.
        </p>
        <p>
          I call this way of looking at the world, or mental model, “Save time
          and money by spending well.”
        </p>
        <p>
          In most languages, there’s a saying that captures that philosophy.
          In The Netherlands, we say, “Buying cheap is expensive.” But this is
          not only true for buying things.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this article, I will share 3 personal examples of my life where I
          applied this mental model and how it changed my life financially.

        <h3>Writing books</h3>
        <p>
          When I wrote my first book in 2015, I didn’t do a great job with the
          presentation and positioning.
        </p>
        <p>
          I called the book Massive Life Success, and I created a silly cover
          on Canva in 30 minutes. Here it is:
        </p>
        <img src="assets/book.jpg" width="100%" alt="" />
        <p>
          It doesn’t even look a little bit like my current books. I didn’t
          have a logo nor did I have a style. The overall feel of the book was
          amateurish.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few weeks after I published it, I started feeling bad about the
          book. I liked the content and advice, but it just didn’t look
          professional. So I took a lot of time and energy to study the book
          business.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also worked on creating a style for all my designs. Call it a
          brand identity. And within a year, I republished the book as, Win
          Your Inner Battles.
        </p>
        <p>
          It came with a new title, cover, and description. I even re-arranged
          the chapters, which made the reading experience easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, seven years later, the book is still selling hundreds of copies
          a month. I learned an important lesson from that experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you’re working on a project, it’s tempting to rush it and
          finish it as fast as you can. You can just “ship it” and move on to
          the next one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don’t be one of those people who turns everything into a rush job.
          Take your time. Invest time and energy in your projects. Do a GREAT
          job. Do the job as best as you can.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first time, I didn’t spend enough time and money on my book. So
          I got a book that wasn’t great. Then, I spent serious time and money
          on creating the best book I could.
        </p>
        <p>And that book is still earning money today.</p>
